She calls out to the man in the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's gettin' cold and there's nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
Oh, think twice
'Cause there's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause there's another day for you
You and me in paradise
She calls out to the man in the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you
You and me in paradise
Oh, Lord
Is there nothing more any one of us can do?
Oh, Lord
Na, na-na, na, na-na-now
